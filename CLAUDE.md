# Project Instructions

Canonical instructions for AI coding agents working in this repository. Claude Code reads this file directly as project memory. Other agents (Cursor, Codex, etc.) reach it via the one-line `AGENTS.md` pointer.

## Streamlit conventions
*Apply only if this project uses Streamlit.*

- `st.set_page_config(layout="wide", page_title="...")` MUST be the first Streamlit call.
- Use `width="stretch"` (and `width="content"` where appropriate) in new and modified code. **Never** introduce new `use_container_width=True` — it is deprecated. When you touch existing code that uses `use_container_width`, migrate it.
- All mutable state in `st.session_state`. No module-level globals.
- `@st.cache_data` for DataFrames/files; `@st.cache_resource` for DB clients/models.
- Every widget needs a stable, explicit `key=`.
- UI code only in the UI directory (e.g. `app/`). Data logic stays in the non-UI package (e.g. `src/`). Never import `streamlit` from non-UI code.
- User feedback via `st.error()` / `st.warning()` / `st.success()`, not `st.write()`.
- **App layout:** main file (e.g. `app.py`) handles only page config, shared state, sidebar, and tab/radio routing. Each tab/mode lives in its own file exposing a `main(...)` (or `render_*`) function. Default to `st.tabs()`; use a sidebar radio only when asked.

## Internal architecture

[`docs/architecture.mmd`](docs/architecture.mmd) is a hand-authored Mermaid diagram of this repo's own internal structure (Streamlit UI tabs, the shared `chunk_runner`/`pipeline` orchestration, the two Gemini backends, post-processing, and external dependencies). Update it in the same PR as any material structural change (a new backend, a tab added/removed, an orchestration module relocated) — same anti-staleness contract as a `.fleet.toml` `description` field. It is not auto-generated and not covered by the pytest suite.
